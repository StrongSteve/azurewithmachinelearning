# Emotion recognition

This section explains the first steps to add emotion recognition:

+ See https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/main/vision/body_analysis/emotion_ferplus for documentation of the emotion recognition model.
+ Add code to use this model to generate the emotion and display it next to the age.
+ Hint 1: It will be similar to the gender recognition.
+ Hint 2: The input dimension is (Nx1x64x64). So the image needs to be grayscale.
